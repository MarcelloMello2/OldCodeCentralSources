Find all files in criteria.
This program support (and for that it’s the best for any developers) :
   1) Searching in DFM (delphi resource).
   2) Output search matching files into a single output text file.
   3) Multy-search for fast search.
   4) Multy-replace strings.

* The file-name in combo-box can be a wild-card.
    For multy file search separate the file names with ‘;’

    e.i : *.exe;*.txt;myDocument.doc

* Look-in combo-box is the folder to search in.
     There can be a sub-folder search by remarking include-subfolder check-mark.

* Single string search is a simple search.
      For multi-string search click the corresponding radio-button and fill the strings in list-box.

* Only for multi-string search there is an option to replace the search strings with others
      (Remember : empty search strings are not replaced mistakenly).

      Replacing string is not done at the original code , but make another copy to a specific folder you define.

     You can load search strings from file , and you can load replace strings from file
       (in format of lines : Source_String=Destination_String).

* Resources such as *.DFM of delphi (T.M) are also identified and search/replace string 
   in such file is also supported

* The search files can be output to a specific file by selecting the "output" tab-control or

  by multi-selecting the output list and by right click the mouse button.
