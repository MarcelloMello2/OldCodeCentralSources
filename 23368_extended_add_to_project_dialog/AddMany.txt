AddMany V4.1

When a project has many files the IDE Project Manager dialogs
may be quite cumbersome. AddMany introduces multiselection dialogs
that make adding and opening units very fast and easy.


Installation

To install AddMany copy AddMany.dll (from the merged
directory) to a directory in your PC and add the complete path
to the IDE 'Known IDE Assemblies' registry key. AddMany.reg
gives a sample.


Usage

AddMany adds 3 items named after the 'Add to Project...' item
in the 'Project' menu.
- 'Add Many to Project...'
  Open a directory selection dialog, the selected directory is
  used as a search starting point for *.pas files (for Delphi
  projects) or *.cs files (for C# projects). The found files
  are shown in a multiselection tree. Clicking Ok adds the
  selected files* to the active project.
- 'Add Project Files to Project...'
  Open file open dialog that asks for a Delphi project whose
  files are then shown in a multiselection tree. Clicking Ok
  adds the selected files* to the active project.
- 'Open Project Files...'
  Open a multiselection dialog with all the units of the
  active project. Clicking Ok opens the selected unit.
