MarcRohloff.BSD.AddInManager Read Me
---------------------------------------

This set of classes is designed to aid in managing BDS Add-Ins (Experts).
It can read and update the list of add-ins and can be used either by a
management GUI or to self-install applications.

It also provides functionality to track different load-types for an add-in
Currently implemented load types are :
  AutoBDS    : Loaded automatically by the BDS
  AutoExpert : Loaded automatically by the Add-In Expert
  Manual     : Loaded manually upon user request


The main classes are:
AddIn          : Detail about a single add-in and it's installation mode
AddInStorage   : Retrieves and saves add-in configurations
AddInInstaller : Provides functions for installing and uninstalling add-ins.


Design goals:
-------------
1) To allow add-ins to automatically install and uninstall themselves.

2) To allow management applications to manage loaded Add-Ins


Future
----------
* Allow add-ins to be unloaded
  As far as I know this is a limitation of the .NET framework. Although the
  BDS could stop using an add-in the framework will stil hold keep the
  assembly file open.

* Possibly allow add-in groups to be created which can be enabled,
  disabled and loaded together.

* Possibly add the capability to control the order in which add-ins are
  loaded. (This is probbaly only possible for expert loaded add-ins)

* Show image in path column to indicate if file is valid (file exists)
  - This is not supported by current (MS) listview
