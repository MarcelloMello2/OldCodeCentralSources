MarcRohloff.AddInExpert Read Me
------------------------------------

This is an add-in which allows BDS add-ins (experts). It allows them to be
added and removed from the BDS Add-Ins list and to be manually loaded.

There are 3 ways in which add-ins can be loaded:
1) Auto-BDS    : The BDS loads these automatically on start-up
2) Auto-Expert : The expert loads the add-ins automatically on start-up
                 (The expert must obviously be installed to do this)
3) Manual      : The Add-In can be loaded manually at any time by opening
                 the expert.

Notes
------
This expert is built upon the abstractions provided by two assemblies:
BDS.Utilities     : This assembly abstracts much of the functionality
                    required to interact with the BDS and to create BDS
                    Add-Ins

BDS.AddInManager : This assembly supplies all the logic required to load,
                   modify and update configurations of the BDS Add-Ins.

Building
---------

You don't NEED to build the code. You can install the files in the 'bin' directory. This being .NET they will install in C# Builder 1 and Delphi 8.

Open the project group from C# Builder and perform a build all.

Note:
You may need to update the reference path to Borland.Studio.ToolsAPI
assembly before you can build. (You can do this by removing and readding it.
right click on the reference and make sure that 'Copy Local' is not
checked)

Installation
-------------
Run the executable created during building. If you have more than one version
of the BDS installed, choose the version you want to modify in the combo-box.
From the 'Options' menu choose install and then click 'OK'.

Uninstallation can be achieved in the same way.

Usage:
------
The expert is an executable which can be run in two modes.

1) It can be run by starting the executable outside of the BDS.
   In this mode it will check which versions of the BDS are installed.
   If there is more than one installed version a combo-box will be available
   to select the version of the BDS you want to configure.

2) It can be installed into a BDS where it will appear as a menu option
   'Add-Ins expert' under the 'Components' menu.

Individual add-ins can be configure, removed or loaded by right-clicking
on the item in the list view.

The list view can also be sorted by clicking
on the headings. The icons indicate the mode in which the add-in
will be added as well as wether it is currently loaded.

Double clicking on an item causes it to load immediately

Clicking on the options button brings up a menu which allows you to
add an item to the list or load an arbitrary add-in. There are also
options to clean the add-in list (remove non-existant items) as well
as to install or uninstall the add-in expert.

Future
----------
* Allow add-ins to be unloaded
  As far as I know this is a limitation of the .NET framework. Although the
  BDS could stop using an add-in the framework will stil hold keep the
  assembly file open.

* Possibly allow add-in groups to be created which can be enabled,
  disabled and loaded together.

* Possibly add the capability to control the order in which add-ins are
  loaded. (This is probbaly only possible for expert loaded add-ins)

* Show image in path column to indicate if file is valid (file exists)
  - This is not supported by current (MS) listview

(This functionality will need to be created in the BDSAddInManager assembly first)
