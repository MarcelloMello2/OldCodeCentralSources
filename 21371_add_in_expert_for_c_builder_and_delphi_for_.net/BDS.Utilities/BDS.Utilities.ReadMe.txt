------------------------------------

This is a set of utilities to facilitate working with BDS Add-Ins.
There are function groups for managing the following:
* General BDS functions
* BDS Services
* Files and Assemblies
* Extra Forms functionality
* Graphics management
* Menus
* Modules in the editor
* BDS Versions (current and installed)

* There is also a base class (BDSAddInBase) which is designed to
  provide much of the functionality required to build a BDS Add-In (Expert)
  and to manage the resources automatically (For example it automatically
  deletes menu items you created).


Design goals:
-------------
1) To abstract the BDS functionality as much as possible and to work
    around bugs.
    For example the bug where shortcuts are reset when loading files
    and also avoiding the necessity to remember the IDs which the
    BDS frequently returns.

2)  To enable applications to be written with a minimum reliance (or in
    some cases no reliance at all) on the Borland.ToolsAPI.
    
3)  To enable a subset of the functions to be called when running outside
    of the BDS. This is so that some program can be run on it's own or
    self-install.
    To this extent there is a property BDS.StandAlone (which detects the
    presence of the Borland.Studio.ToolsAPI assembly)

Future
----------
This is very much a work in progress. I have defined the feature set that I
have used so far and refine it as I use it.

The one area which has been left out is working out the capabilites of
an installed BDS Version (SKU, Supprot for ECO, etc). I am still deciding
how best to achieve this.

Bugs
-----
None that I know of
