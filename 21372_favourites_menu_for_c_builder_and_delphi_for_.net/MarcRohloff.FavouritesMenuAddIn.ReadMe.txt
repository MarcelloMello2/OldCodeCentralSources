MarcRohloff.FavouritesMenuAddIn Read Me
-----------------------------------------

I often find that the recent files list in C# Builder no longer contains
the files which I most often use. This add-in as an update of the previous
version which I had created for Delphi 5. It adds a 'Favourites' menu
option in the 'File' menu. But you can make it add a 'Favorites' menu option
if you prefer it that way.

Notes
------
This expert is built upon the abstractions provided by two assemblies:
BDS.Utilities     : This assembly abstracts much of the functionality
                    required to interact with the BDS and to create BDS
                    Add-Ins

BDS.AddInManager : This assembly supplies all the logic required to automatically
                   install and uninstall add-ins.


Building
---------
You don't NEED to build the code. You can install the files in the 'bin' directory. This being .NET they will install in C# Builder 1 and Delphi 8.

Open the Favourites menu project group. Open the project options for
the FavouritesExpert project and choose the British build (or the
American build if you prefer spelling it 'Favorite')

Perform a build all projects.

Note:
You may need to update the reference path to Borland.Studio.ToolsAPI
assembly before you can build. (You can do this by removing and readding it.
right click on the reference and make sure that 'Copy Local' is not
checked)

Installation
-------------
Run the executable created during building.
A dialog will be shown displaying all the installed BDS Versions.
Multi-select the versions you want to install the menu into and click the
'Install' button.

The same process can be repeated to uninstall the add-in when required.

Usage
------
The expert appears as a 'Favourite' menu option under the 'File' menu.

Initially the favourites list is empty except for the 'Add File', 'Add project'
and 'Edit Favourites' options. These first two can be used to add the
currently active file, project or project group to the menu. Once they have been
added you can open them simply by clicking on their menu items.

You can also use the 'Edit Favourites' option to bring up a configuration form.
The form contains a list of favourites and several buttons. These are
Up and Down   : Moves a favourite up or down in the list (Shift-Up, Shift-Down)
Add Item      : Adds a new item below the currently selected item (Ins key)
Add Seperator : Adds a seperator below the currently selected item  (- Key)
Delete        : Deletes the currently selected item (Del Key)
Clean         : Cleans the favourites list by removing non-existant
                files and redundant seperators.

You can also drag items to reorder the list or drag files across from windows
explorer.
If you select an item and type a key combination using control, alt or
shift then a shortcut will be assigned for the menu item.
(Pressing space clears the shortcut)

Lastly there are two options to control the display format of the items in
the favourites menu. Choose one of:
Fullname      : Always displays the fullname and path
Filename Only : Only displays the filename
Relative      : Displays a relative path if possible,
                Otherwise displays the fullname
You can also choose to hide the file extensions.
