The Templates add-in has been designed to aid with project and unit level add-in creation. Instead of writing a new add-in for every project or unit, you create a configuration file for your project or unit template and setup Templates add-in to use that new template. Templates are used to extend Delphi's File|New dialog, allowing you to create new projects or units based on configured templates.

This distribution includes Windows Service, OTA Menu Project and several Design Patterns templates:

* Windows Service Application Template (File|New|Other|Other Projects|...) - creates a skeleton of the .NET Windows Service application.

* OTA Menu Project Template (File|New|Other|Other Projects|...) - creates a skeleton of the menu-based OTA project. The OTA project is setup to add a single menu item to Delphi's main menu and show a message box when that item is selected.

* Design Patterns Templates and Demos (File|New|Other|Design Patterns|... and File|New|Other|Design Patterns|Demos|...) - creates singleton and observer design patterns classes. It also creates singleton and observer demo applications.
