These *.fzs files are 

FuzRegex scripts

and they are meant to be used with FuzRegex (www.fuzregex.com)

They were demonstrated during the Code Rage presentations.

They can be opened as plain-text files and the regular expression 
syntax may be generally of integer (i.e. without FuzRegex).
