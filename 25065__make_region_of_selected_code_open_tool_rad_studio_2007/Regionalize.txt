Regionalize V4.0

Regionalize makes very easy to add and remove 'regions' around blocks
of selected code.


Installation

To install Regionalize copy Regionalize.dll and Regionalize.xml (from
the merged directory) to a directory in your PC and add the complete path
to the IDE 'Known IDE Assemblies' registry key. Regionalize.reg
gives a sample.


Usage

Regionalize adds a item named 'Regionalize' at the end of the IDE Edit menu.
This item has two subitems.
- 'Make Region of Selection'
  Add a region around selected text.
- 'Remove Region around Selection'
  Remove a region around selected text.

To add a region
1 - If you want a titled region ({$region 'title'}) add a comment before
    the first line of the block of text you want to be regionalized using
    double slash or { }. Otherwise goto (!) step 2.
2 - Select the block of text you want to be regionalized (including the
    title comment if any).
3 - Select 'Make Region of Selection' or use the shortcut.
If the first line (when there is no title comment) or the second line
(when there is a title comment) of the selection already contains a
region directive the command is ignored.
If the selection is a comment enclosed with { } or (* *) the first
line is used as title and the comment open and close tokens are kept
on the same lines of the open and close region directives.

To remove a region
1 - Select the region you want to be unregionalized.
2 - Select 'Remove Region around Selection' or use the shortcut.
If the first line of the selection or the last line of the selection do
not contain the region directives the command is ignored.
